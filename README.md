# Barotropic model - implemented by C and Python

This is an implement of barotropic model.  

- Double periodic boundary conditions
- Poisson equation is solved by FFT method
- Leapfrog and Robert & Asselin time filter for time integration.
- Second-order finite difference for spatial discretization.
